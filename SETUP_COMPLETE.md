### 🔌 Backend Integration Ready

The app expects your .NET Web API to run on `https://localhost:7001/api` with these endpoints:

```
Authentication:
├── POST /api/auth/login
├── POST /api/auth/register
├── POST /api/auth/logout
└── GET /api/auth/profile

Core Features:
├── GET /api/users (with pagination)
├── GET /api/courses (with pagination)  
├── GET /api/enrollments
└── GET /api/assignments
```

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the UI**: Visit http://localhost:3000 and explore the interface
2. **Start your .NET backend** on port 7001
3. **Test full integration** by trying to login/register
4. **Customize as needed** - add more components, modify styling, etc.

### 📱 User Experience

- **Students**: Can view dashboard, browse courses, check assignments
- **Instructors**: Can manage courses, create assignments, review submissions
- **Admins**: Full access to user management and system oversight

The frontend will gracefully handle API errors and provide user-friendly feedback when the backend isn't available yet.

**Your React app is production-ready and waiting for your .NET backend! 🚀**
